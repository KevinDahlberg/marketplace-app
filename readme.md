## Project Overview
The original project was a group assignment during my 7th week of in-class work
at Prime Digital Academy.  This is my personal attempt at the project.


### Summary
The project involves creating a Marketplace Game.  The game has multiple market
items that randomly go up or down in price after a 15 second interval.  The player
clicks on each item when they want to "buy" them.  When an item is purchased, it
appears in the player's inventory.  The player can then sell the product after it
is in their inventory

### Technologies Used
* Angular
* ES6
* Bootstrap
* Grunt

##Goals
* Write a full-stack version of the app using Angular, ES6 and Bootstrap
* Explore OOP programming principles
* Apply all of the concepts learned in Tier 2 of Primes
