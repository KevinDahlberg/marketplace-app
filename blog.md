- Next task is to spin up the server
* Server is spun up

- Need to set up Index.html and Create .js with inventory
* inventory.js created with inventory in it.
* set up index.html and sourced the inventory, client js, style.css and the other relevant items.
* set up client.js and angular (myApp).  Also set up angular-routes.
  * I'm not sure if I am going to need/use angular-routes for this project.  It's
    there and set up just in case I spose.

- Need to set up DOM so that it shows the starting inventory
* inventory items are showing up in DOM
  * it's pretty cool that I can create the array of objects in one spot and have them appear in a different spot.
